## Description

Following seminal and recent work in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in law enforcement and digital forensics, such as work on automated evidence analysis, predictive policing, and automated bias-neutralisation in digital investigations, there is a growing interest in developing AI methods, theories, and tools tailored for law enforcement and criminal investigations. This has sparked initiatives such as the research network DigForASP (Digital forensics: evidence analysis via intelligent systems and practices). This workshop adopts a socio-technical perspective on integrating AI methods across diverse stages in public safety and criminal justice processes. From preventive measures and educational efforts to operational support during law enforcement activities and post-incident digital forensics, the workshop engages in discussions encompassing theoretical, methodological, and technological approaches for such systems. As awareness grows regarding the demand for Trustworthy AI in intelligent systems, factors like transparency, accountability, human agency, and bias mitigation in AI technology are gaining increased importance. This workshop is dedicated to fostering discussions on advancements for the responsible integration of AI in law enforcement and criminal investigations.

Keywords: Trustworthy AI, Socio-Technical Systems, Law Enforcement, Criminal Investigations.

## Topics of Interest
- **Predictive Policing:** Strategies for proactive crime prediction and prevention in law enforcement, and, e.g., integrating principles for fair and unbiased predictions.
- **Tactical Decision Support:** Approaches to automated decision-making in critical scenarios for law enforcement and first responders, and, e.g., addressing transparency in AI algorithms.
- **Smart Devices and Internet of Things (IoT) in Law Enforcement:** Interactions with smart technology, smart sensors, drones, and mixed-reality devices in law enforcement, and, e.g., addressing processing of sensitive and personal data. 
- **Image and Video Analysis in Law Enforcement:** Integration of AI-driven tools for analysing images and videos in crime scene reconstruction, and e.g., considering the ethical use of data and maintaining privacy standards.
- **Cybercrime Understanding and Detection:** Methods and applications for detecting and preventing cybercrimes, and, e.g., addressing transparency in AI algorithms.
- **Automated Evidence Analysis:** Implementation of AI tools for efficient and thorough analysis of digital evidence, and e.g., addressing traceability and fairness in decision-making.
- **Behavioural Analysis:** Techniques for AI-based behavioural analysis to identify patterns in criminal activities, e.g., by considering ethical aspects such as unbiased profiling.
- **Biometric Identification:** Utilising AI in biometric identification processes while approaching ethical demands, such as privacy standards and ensuring secure and ethical handling of sensitive information.
- **Socio-Technical Aspects of AI Integration in Law enforcement:** Exploration of socio-technical perspectives on AI in law enforcement and criminal investigation, considering the ethical implications and societal impacts of AI integration.
- **AI Integrated in Law Enforcement Training and Education:** Harnessing AI Systems in Police education, AI-powered training simulations, tools and methods.
- **Trustworthy AI Assessment Tools:** Methods and applications for assessing Trustworthy AI solutions in the field of law enforcement. 

## Format

This is a half-day workshop that will follow the classical format of presentations of peer-reviewed papers followed by discussion. The workshop is divided into technical sessions with 20-minute presentations for full papers and 10-minute presentations for short papers.

Submissions of full scientific contributions (7 pages + 1 page for references), short position papers (5 pages + 1 page for references), and proposals of technical talks (1-page, including abstract and author biography) will be reviewed by the Program Committee using a single-blind reviewing process with no rebuttal phase.

We aim at selecting extended and revised versions of accepted papers to appear in a special issue of an international journal provided that a sufficient amount of high quality papers is collected. Such papers will go through a second formal selection process to meet the high quality standard of the journal.
