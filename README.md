## Description

Following seminal and recent work in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in law enforcement and digital forensics, such as work on automated evidence analysis, predictive policing, and automated bias-neutralisation in digital investigations, there is a growing interest in developing AI methods, theories, and tools tailored for law enforcement and criminal investigations. This has sparked initiatives such as the research network DigForASP (Digital forensics: evidence analysis via intelligent systems and practices). This workshop adopts a socio-technical perspective on integrating AI methods across diverse stages in public safety and criminal justice processes. From preventive measures and educational efforts to operational support during law enforcement activities and post-incident digital forensics, the workshop engages in discussions encompassing theoretical, methodological, and technological approaches for such systems. As awareness grows regarding the demand for Trustworthy AI in intelligent systems, factors like transparency, accountability, human agency, and bias mitigation in AI technology are gaining increased importance. This workshop is dedicated to fostering discussions on advancements for the responsible integration of AI in law enforcement and criminal investigations.

Keywords: Trustworthy AI, Socio-Technical Systems, Law Enforcement, Criminal Investigations.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers to discuss initiatives that address the integration of Trustworthy AI and Law Enforcement. We will invite theoretical, experimental and position papers.

## Topics of Interest
- Predictive Policing
- Tactical Decision Support
- Smart Devices and Internet of Things (IoT) in Law Enforcement
- Image and Video Analysis in Law Enforcement
- Cybercrime Understanding and Detection
- Automated Evidence Analysis
- Behavioural Analysis
- Biometric Identification
- Socio-Technical Aspects of AI Integration in Law Enforcement
- AI Integrated in Law Enforcement Training and Education
- Trustworthy AI Assessment Tools

## Format

This is a half-day workshop that will follow the classical format of presentations of peer-reviewed papers followed by discussion. The workshop is divided into technical sessions with 20-minute presentations for full papers and 10-minute presentations for short papers.

Submissions of full scientific contributions (7 pages + 1 page for references), short position papers (5 pages + 1 page for references), and proposals of technical talks (1-page, including abstract and author biography) will be reviewed by the Program Committee using a single-blind reviewing process with no rebuttal phase.

We aim at selecting extended and revised versions of accepted papers to appear in a special issue of an international journal provided that a sufficient amount of high quality papers is collected. Such papers will go through a second formal selection process to meet the high quality standard of the journal.
